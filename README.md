If youâ€™ve lost a tooth and thinking of implant, rememberâ€”itâ€™s a surgery. In a multispeciality hospital, the implant team consists of oral surgeon, dentist, anesthetist (if needed), lab, sterilization, X-ray, and emergency backup. You get pre-surgery consultation, imaging (like CBCT), anaesthesia, implant placement under sterile OT conditions, antibiotics/pain meds, aftercare.

At Care and Cure Hospital, dental implants are done in surgical OT under strict hygiene, with proper pain management and follow-up support. So itâ€™s safer than small clinics.
